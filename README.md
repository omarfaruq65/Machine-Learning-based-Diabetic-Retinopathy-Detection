# Machine-Learning-based-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection

Diabetic Retinopathy dataset collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This dataset contains features extracted from the Messidor image set to predict whether an image contains signs of diabetic retinopathy or not.

We tested Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes but Support Vector Machine gave best accuracy in all of them. 
There are \n
Support Vector Machine = 0.74 \n
Logistic Regression = 0.72
Random Forest = 0.69
K-Nearest Neighbors =  0.66
Decision Tree = 0.61
Naive Bayes = 0.57
